	Purpose:  This script can be used to resize one or more images.  It will save the file to a directory and output the path to that directory which you 
			  can display or write to a databse. 
	
	TO USE, SET: 
		$filename = image to be resized
		$newfilename = added to filename to for each use to keep from overwriting images created example thumbnail_$filename is how it will be saved.
		$path = where the image should be stored and accessed. 
		$newwidth = resized width could be larger or smaller
		$newheight = resized height could be larger or smaller
		
	SAMPLE OF FUNCTION: makeimage('image.jpg','fullimage_','imgs/',250,250)
	
	Include the file containing the function in your document and simply call the function with the correct parameters and your image will be resized.
